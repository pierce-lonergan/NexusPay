# DECISIONS — append-only ADR log

## ADR-001 | 2026-06-09 | Bootstrap PERPETUA into NexusPay at L1
Context: repo did not build/run; large uncommitted audit-fix body. Decision:
adopt PERPETUA v2; operate L1 (branch+local commits, no push/PR/merge) until the
human ratifies CHARTER (Q-001). Alternatives: L0 advisor (rejected — fixes
already exist and must be preserved); L2 (rejected — no ratification yet).

## ADR-002 | 2026-06-09 | Declare common/payment/ledger/iam as Modulith OPEN
Context: these modules' subpackages (ports, domain, id, exceptions, avro) are
consumed across the system; default base-package-only exposure made Modulith
verification fail. Decision: mark them `Type.OPEN` (transitional). Alternative:
`@NamedInterface` on each exposed package (deferred — larger, per-package
curation). Metric: ModulithVerificationTest passes; revisit at a meta-review to
tighten OPEN → NamedInterface.

## ADR-003 | 2026-06-09 | Relocate @SpringBootApplication to io.nexuspay root
Context: under io.nexuspay.app, Boot auto-config packages + Modulith saw no
sibling modules. Decision: move to io.nexuspay. Alternative: explicit
`scanBasePackages`/`@EntityScan` lists (rejected — brittle, must enumerate 16
modules). Metric: app boots through bean wiring; Modulith detects all modules.

## ADR-004 | 2026-06-09 | DataSource decoration via BeanPostProcessor
Context: a `@Bean DataSource` that consumed a `DataSource` created a
Flyway↔datasource dependency cycle that blocked startup. Decision: wrap the
existing DataSource bean in a `BeanPostProcessor` (no new bean edge).
Alternative: `@DependsOn`/`@Primary` juggling (rejected — fragile). Note: the
RLS `SET LOCAL`-on-checkout mechanism itself is still semantically broken
(B-002); this ADR only fixes the boot cycle.

## ADR-006 | 2026-06-10 | Billing scheduler lock fails CLOSED + renews its lease
Context (B-001): billing crons fired on every replica → double-charges. Decision:
a Valkey SET-NX-EX lock (like OutboxRelay) BUT (a) fail CLOSED on Valkey-down —
skip the cycle rather than run unguarded, because the work is due-based and
self-heals next cycle whereas an unguarded run double-charges; (b) RENEW the
lease at ttl/3 while work runs (a long ≤500-sub charge loop could otherwise
outlive a fixed TTL and let a second replica start — adversarial review found
this; new invoice per cycle ⇒ new idempotency key ⇒ no downstream dedup); (c)
atomic owner-checked Lua for renew+release so neither can touch a lease another
instance now holds. Alternatives: fail-open (rejected — money); fixed TTL +
batch cap (rejected — fragile vs PSP latency). Residual: renewal *timing* is
integration-tested only; fail-closed safety assumes due-based re-selection
(B-017 regression test).

## ADR-005 | 2026-06-09 | Reconciliation/dispute ports backed by the ledger module
Context: PaymentQueryPort/LedgerQueryPort (recon) and LedgerPort (dispute) had no
implementations → context fails. reconciliation/dispute may depend on `ledger`
(OPEN) but NOT on `payment`. Decision: implement against the ledger's
JournalEntryRepository / CreateJournalEntryUseCase. Consequence: reconciliation
is effectively settlement↔ledger two-way (no reachable payment read-model);
documented in the adapter + a future payment read-model (B-003-adjacent) would
upgrade it to true three-way. Alternative: leave unimplemented (rejected — app
won't start).
